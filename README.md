Bulk Export (module for Omeka S)
================================

[Bulk Export] is a generic export module for [Omeka S] that provides common
output formats (json, xml, spreadsheet), both for admin and public sides. It is
easily extensible by other modules.

Other known modules that provides output: [Bibliography].

Internally, it allows to manage output formats, that are responsible for
exporting metadata into a file, a stream or as a string.

a spreadsheet, that can be imported automatically by [Bulk Import].
